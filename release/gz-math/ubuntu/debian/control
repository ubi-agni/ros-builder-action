Description: Gazebo Math Library - Shared library
 A small, fast, and high performance math library. This library is a
 self-contained set of classes and functions suitable for robot applications.
 .
 Gazebo is a set of simple libraries that provide useful
 functionality to bootstrap robot applications. The included libraries
 encapsulate all the essentials, such as common math data types, console
 logging, 3D mesh management, and asynchronous message passing.
