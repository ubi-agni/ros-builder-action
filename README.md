## github action to build .deb packages from ROS sources

This repository provides actions and resusable workflows helping to build Debian packages from ROS package sources.

For convenience, the built packages from [`ros-one.repos`](./ros-one.repos) are deployed to https://ros.packages.techfak.net.  
If you want any other packages to be included in the repository, please open an issue or pull request.

### Interactive build workflow

For building a ROS distro it is recommended to use the high-level [interactive.yaml](https://github.com/ubi-agni/ros-builder-action/actions/workflows/interactive.yaml) workflow.
This manually triggered workflow builds all packages from the given source(s) and provides the resulting `.debs` as an artifact. Optionally, the `.debs` can be [deployed to a github repo](#where-to-deploy). However, using github for this purpose is not recommended (slow and size limitations). Better use a dedicated repository server like [aptly](https://www.aptly.info/) or [reprepro](https://wiki.debian.org/SettingUpSignedAptRepositoryWithReprepro). The [`reprepro-import.sh`](reprepro-import.sh) script helps with the latter.

### What to build?

`ROS_SOURCES` specifies a (space-separated) list of inputs. Usually these should be `.repos` or `.rosinstall` files suitable for `vcs import`.
However, an URL pointing to a release `.tar.gz` or a github repository is also supported. In the latter case, use the following scheme: `github:organization/repo#version`. Other URLs are interpreted as inputs for `vcs import`.

A subset of packages can be selected via [colcon package selection options](https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/reference/package-selection-arguments.html) specified in `COLCON_PKG_SELECTION`. <a name="pkg-selection-examples"></a>For example:
- To rebuild a specific package and all its downstream dependencies:  
  `--packages-above-and-dependencies <pkg ...>`
- To rebuild a single package (only use if ABI/API hasn't changed):  
  `--packages-select <pkg ...>`

### Where to start building from?

Building a complete ROS distro from scratch takes a lot of time, often more than the 6 hours allowed by default GHA runners. For this reason, it is possible to continue a build either from a previous build (downloading an existing `debs` artifact) or from an existing repository. For the former, set the input `DOWNLOAD_DEBS=true`, for the latter add the deploy repository to `EXTRA_DEB_SOURCES`. Note that this variable supports shell variable expansion, i.e. you can use `$DEB_DISTRO` and/or `$ROS_DISTRO` to generically specify the deploy repository across different builds.
In both cases, set the variable/input `SKIP_EXISTING=true` to actually skip building already existing packages.

In the `interactive.yaml` workflow, a combination of these options is offered:
- Tick option `Continue from previous build` to draw on https://ros.packages.techfak.net (or untick to trigger a clean build from sratch).
- Tick option `Skip already built packages?` to skip existing packages (or untick to enforce a rebuild).
- Simply rerun the workflow to automatically continue building a previous build that was cancelled due to a timeout.

### Reusable workflows [build.yaml](.github/workflows/build.yaml) + [deploy.yaml](.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)

These workflows are intended for reuse by an external repository to build a custom list of ROS packages. The `build` workflow stores created `.debs` as an artifact that can be manually downloaded or automatically uploaded to a repository server (via the `deploy` workflow) subsequently.

A simple usage example looks like this:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    uses: ubi-agni/ros-builder-action/.github/workflows/build.yaml@main
    with:
      ROS_SOURCES: '*.repos'

  deploy:
    needs: build
    if: always()
    uses: ubi-agni/ros-builder-action/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml@main
    with:
      DEPLOY_URL: ${{ vars.DEPLOY_URL || 'self' }}
      TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}                  # used for own repo
      SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_PRIVATE_KEY }}  # used for other repo
```

More complex usage examples can be found in [interactive.yaml](.github/workflows/interactive.yaml).

### Environment variables

The build process is controlled by several environment variables. Usually, those environment variables are inititialized from inputs, [repository variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables), or the given default value - in that order.

`DEBUG_BASH`           | boolean | false    | Enable bash debugging (`set -x`) and tracing

### Where to deploy?

The built packages can be deployed to a flat Debian repository, for example on a github branch.
The easiest way to do so is to specify `DEPLOY_URL=self`, causing deployment to the active github repository into the branch `$DEB_DISTRO-$ROS-DISTRO`.
However, you can also specify another github repo.
